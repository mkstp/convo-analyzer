# CONVO ANALYZER

Interpersonal relations which are characterized by a high degree of similarity generally lead to better negotiated outcomes for both parties. This project takes a time-stamped speaker identified transcript as input and measures similarity along the following parameters, plotted over rounds and turns taken:

- sentiment 
- sentence similarity 
- time spoken per person
- rate of speaking per person

A round is a sequence of two turns between two speakers, completed after the second speaker finishes.
